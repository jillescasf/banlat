# Nakano's theorem

For a Banach lattice the following are equivalent:

* the norm is order continuous;
* the lattice is σ-conditionally complete and the norm is σ-order continuous;
* every increasing order-bounded sequence converges in norm.

The equivalence is recorded through the corresponding implications between
order continuity, σ-conditional completeness, σ-order continuity, and monotone
norm convergence of bounded sequences.
