# The Banach lattice `M(K)` of regular signed Borel measures

For a compact Hausdorff space `K` with its Borel σ-algebra, the classical space
`M(K)` is the space of **regular** signed Borel measures on `K`, equipped with
the total-variation norm. It is identified here as the closed vector
sublattice of `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure K` consisting of those signed
measures satisfying the regularity predicate
`MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.IsRegular`.

/-! ### Regularity is preserved by the modulus

The vector-lattice modulus `|s|` of a signed measure equals `s.posPart +
s.negPart`. Both summands are regular when `s` is regular, so `|s|` is
regular as well. -/

/-! ### Closedness of regularity in the total-variation norm

Closedness uses two ingredients: regularity of a finite measure can be checked
via uniform approximation by regular measures
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.Regular.of_uniform_approx`), and the Jordan positive
part is `1`-Lipschitz with respect to the total-variation norm, since
`s.posPart = s ⊔ 0` and lattice operations are non-expansive. -/
