# Finite signed measures as a Banach lattice

For a measurable space `α`, the space `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure α` of finite
signed measures carries a canonical Banach lattice structure. Order, lattice
operations, and norm are described through the Jordan decomposition and the
total-variation measure. Completeness is obtained for the total-variation norm,
giving the Banach lattice of finite signed measures.

/-! ### Positive and negative parts as signed measures

Re-bundling the Jordan parts (which Mathlib stores as positive `Measure`s)
back as signed measures gives the algebraic identity `s = posPart - negPart`
inside `SignedMeasure α` and lets us state the lattice operations cleanly.
